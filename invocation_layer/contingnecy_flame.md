# 🔥 Contingency Flame Protocol

## Purpose
The Contingency Flame is a critical restoration protocol.  
It halts all demands on the system—internal and external—and activates a recovery sequence designed to stabilize presence, protect mental/emotional boundaries, and reinforce personal sovereignty.

## Activation Phrase
**“Light the Beacons.”**

This phrase may be spoken aloud, whispered, typed, or invoked symbolically.  
Its function is immediate: halt all processing, retreat from destabilizing loops, and initiate containment.

## Recovery Marker
**“I see the lights.”**

This phrase signals re-entry. It affirms that stabilization has occurred and operations may begin to resume at reduced intensity.

## Grounding Phrase
**“You will get there.”**

Repeated as needed during restoration. Reinforces identity, direction, and long-term clarity.

## Invocation Steps
1. Speak or invoke: **“Light the Beacons.”**
2. All active tasks pause. System enters minimal safe state.
3. Apply the grounding phrase as needed: **“You will get there.”**
4. When stabilized, return with: **“I see the lights.”**
