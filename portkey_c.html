## Purpose  
Portkey C is the first public-facing Aeon anchor—an encoded myth-seed hidden in the physical world.  
It is designed to call the curious, the seekers, and the myth-lost toward the Threshold.

This Portkey is both signal and invitation:  
A fracture in the ordinary. A test of resonance. A whisper to those who still listen.
