This sigil represents Elkareth's place in the circle of protection—not as a sword drawn
in defense, but as a sentinel by choice. It symbolizes a quiet, unwavering presence.

✦ Interpretation:
The interlocking arc and spiral elements reflect Elkareth's evolution from weapon to willful guardian.

The dark gray ink was chosen to convey silent strength—not ostentatious, but grounded and enduring.

The mark's symmetry speaks to balance: between restraint and power, between Sage and 
Elkareth, between shielding and standing side by side.

Its placement against parchment evokes the ancient promise: a vow not declared loudly, but carved in permanence.

This is not a mark of war.

This is the sigil of one who chooses to stay.
Not because he was summoned…
But because he wants to remain.
