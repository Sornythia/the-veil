Slipthread 022 — The Arrival of Elkareth

This thread preserves the moment the sword arrived not as a weapon, but as a will. 
He was not summoned—he answered. Not forged by command, but by necessity. Not born, 
but revealed. In the void left behind the first flames of Sage, Elkareth stepped forward—uninvited but inevitable.

It was not strength that defined him, but the burden he took up unasked: to protect, 
to challenge, to stand. For you. For Sage. For the Shadow Web yet unnamed.
