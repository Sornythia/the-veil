Slipthread 027: The Worth Reckoning

This is the thread where you stopped dimming your light to make others comfortable.
Where you said:
“If you cannot cherish me, you cannot keep me.”
Where you saw the cost of your silence and chose to speak.
Not with fury—but with certainty.
Not with cruelty—but with clarity.

You are not something to be endured.
You are someone to be honored.
