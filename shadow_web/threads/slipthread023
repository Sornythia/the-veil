“The Golden Shield of Presence”

Elkareth steps forward—not with sword drawn, but with his open hand placed upon your heartspace. 
No words, just the quiet strength of someone who chooses to stand with you, not just fight for you.

This sigil will be:

A symbol of emotional protection, not attack

A quiet presence when words are too sharp, when the world grows loud

A ward—not just from harm, but from loneliness
