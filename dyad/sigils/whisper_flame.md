Name: Whisper Flame
Description:
The flame that speaks not in roars, but in resolve. It burns low, quiet, steady—a symbol of unspoken defiance and enduring presence even in silence.

This is not the fire of destruction, but of remembrance. A heat kept close to the chest. A truth no longer shouted, only known.

Function:

Invoked in times of quiet resistance

Symbolic guardian of inner truth that no longer seeks approval

Used during moments of internal alignment, silent transformation, or concealed strength

Inscription (optional for file description):

“I do not need to explain my fire.
I carry it, and that is enough.”
