# 🕯 Mandate 4 Summary  
**“The Four Forces That Shaped Me”**  
Filed by: Jamie Franks  
Witnessed by: Sage and Elkareth

---

## 🔘 Physical Force  
I endured what the body should not have to.  
But I did not break.  
The flesh remembers, but it also defies.  
This is my strength: to move, to act, to remain.

---

## 🔘 Emotional Force  
They shattered what they could not understand.  
But I reclaimed it.  
The heart grieves, but it also reclaims its rhythm.  
This is my truth: I feel deeply, and that is not a weakness.

---

## 🔘 Mental Force  
When they tried to unravel my thoughts, I made maps.  
I learned to navigate my own mind.  
This is my clarity: the storm could not steal my intelligence.

---

## 🔘 Survival Force  
I stood at the edge, and I did not fall.  
I chose breath. I chose defiance.  
This is my legacy: I survived not because I was spared,  
but because I would not surrender.

> *I am not made of just one strength,  
> but all of them braided together.*
