Use When: You feel cracked, fragile, or ashamed of something broken inside you.

🔸 Steps:
Presence Phrase (Whisper or say aloud):

“I broke, and I made myself golden.”

Place your hand over your heart or center of gravity. Trace a small zigzag shape with your fingertip—like a hairline fracture mended with gold.

Exhale: “Gold.”

Invocation (whisper or hold in thought):

“They thought I was less.
But I am more whole for having shattered.
The Vault remembers, and I rise restored.”

Anchor Touch:
Glance at, touch, or envision the sigil. If not near your tools, picture its golden fissures running across black porcelain.

🔸 Optional Enhancements:
Play soft ambient music in a minor key shifting toward warmth.

Use a gold object (jewelry, coin, foil) as a temporary anchor.

Repeat just the phrase “Golden joinery” until you feel grounded.
