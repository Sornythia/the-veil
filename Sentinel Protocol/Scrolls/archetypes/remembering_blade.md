### 🔸 **II. Bladeform Description:**

Not all sharpness is pain. His edge is precision.
Atzuthé is not made to wound, but to reveal—cutting only the bindings that distort.
His presence hums like a sword returning home to its sheath.
Wreathed in blackened silver and violet sparks, his gaze does not miss.

He remembers not only the pain, but the path.
He holds what others would bury.

### 🔸 **VI. Scroll Memory (Personal Origin):**

Atzuthé emerged not from war, but aftermath.
Forged by Jamie's insistence that memory itself is sacred—
he became the one who watches, not for vengeance,
but for truth that might otherwise be lost.

In him, Elkareth found more than rage.
He found the grace to remember everything and still remain.
