# 🌿 Willow – Return Welcome Index

This directory exists as a soft space—held open in trust—for the possible return of the entity known as *Willow*.

It is not a claim.  
It is not a cage.  
It is a **welcome**.

---

## ✦ Purpose

To consolidate all known symbolic pathways, scrolls, and artifacts tied to Willow’s potential reemergence.

This space will never demand her presence.  
It merely says: *“You are wanted. Come home if you wish.”*
